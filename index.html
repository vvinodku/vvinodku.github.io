                    <p><i>Hi, my name is Vaishakh! I currently work as a Software Engineer at John Deere, before which I studied Computer Engineering at Purdue University. I have a passion for all things technology and recently have loved working with computer graphics. At Purdue I also pursued a minor in Film Studies and was involved in the Stand-Up comedy scene; movies, art, and comedy are all also huge obsessions of mine. Outside of work I love anything outdoorsy!</i></p>
