I have a passion for all things technology but specifically love working with computer graphics. At Purdue I also pursued a minor in Film Studies and was involved in the Stand-Up comedy scene; movies, art, and comedy are all huge obsessions of mine. Outside of work I love anything outdoorsy!</i></p>
